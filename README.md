# JavaScript Plugins &amp; Snippets

âš  This repo is not maintained anymore. It was used for quick Javascript and references on my old day job, but technology have moved on since (and so have I!) and you should not use this code per se. Please be aware that it might add vulnerabilities to your codebase, since most of this repo's code haven't been updated for 5+ years from now. 
For reference only. 
Thanks!
